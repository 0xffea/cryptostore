A storage engine for crypto market data. You supply the exchanges, data type (trade, book, etc), and trading pairs you're interested in and Cryptostore does the rest!


### ** Work in Progress **
Planned features

* Dynamic/Reloadable Config
* Store data to a variety of formats (databases, parquet, etc)
* Missing data detection and correction (for exchanges that support historical data, typically only trade data)
